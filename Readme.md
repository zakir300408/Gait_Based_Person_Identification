# Gait-Based Person Identification

This repository contains code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and inference for gait based person identification from walking patterns.

## Repository contents

- `main_MB_3.py` is the main entry point for running the proposed method
- `ablation/` contains scripts that support and test preprocessing design choices and window configurations
- `baselines/` contains all baseline methods reported in the paper
- `gait_id_pelvis_62.h5` is the dataset with 62 subjects used in the paper

## Data

The file `gait_id_pelvis_62.h5` stores preprocessed gait signals for 62 subjects. Place this file at the repository root or update any data path used by your scripts.
